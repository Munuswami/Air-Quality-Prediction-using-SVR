# Air Quality Prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR)
## Project Overview:
This project involves developing a predictive model to estimate the Air Quality Index (AQI) using Support Vector Regression (SVR). The model utilizes various environmental features such as pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc.), weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and other relevant factors to predict AQI. ## Features - **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess the air quality dataset. -
**Data Cleaning**:
Handle missing values and preprocess features. - **Feature Engineering**: Select and scale relevant features for the model. - 
**Model Training**: Train an SVR model using the RBF kernel. - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics. - 
**Visualization**: Visualize the actual vs. predicted AQI to assess the model's performance. 
## Prerequisites :
- Python 3.x
- - Required libraries:
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`
    - `scikit-learn`
## IDE:
The best IDE for this project is Jupyter Notebook.
**Results**
The project provides the following key results:

**Model Performance**: 
The SVR model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.

**Visualization**: 
A scatter plot comparing the actual AQI values with the predicted AQI values, along with a reference line for perfect predictions.
